This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to implicit returns from functions.  When a function doesn't explicitly assign a value to its name, and the condition causing it to not reach an assignment evaluates to true, it implicitly returns an empty variant. This often leads to unexpected results that can be difficult to debug.  The `bug.vbs` file shows the buggy code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version.
